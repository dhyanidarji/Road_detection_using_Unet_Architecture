# Road_detection_using_Unet_Architecture
This repository implements a semantic segmentation model for road detection using the U-Net architecture. U-Net is a popular convolutional neural network designed for biomedical image segmentation but has proven effective in other domains, including road detection in satellite or aerial imagery.

Features
Model Architecture: Implements U-Net with configurable depth, filters, and activation functions.
Dataset Support: Designed to work with road segmentation datasets, including custom and public datasets like the Massachusetts Roads Dataset.
Preprocessing: Includes utilities for data augmentation, resizing, normalization, and splitting into training, validation, and test sets.
Training Pipeline: End-to-end training pipeline with support for callbacks, learning rate schedulers, and checkpointing.
Evaluation Metrics: Calculates segmentation-specific metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU), F1 Score, Precision, and Recall.
Visualization: Tools to visualize predictions, ground truth, and overlayed results.
